      <h3>Welcome to MDII Desktop App</h3>
      <p>
        You're using this <strong>offline-friendly desktop app</strong> because your work may happen in areas with limited or intermittent internet access. 
        This tool is built to help you run <strong>inclusiveness evaluations</strong> of digital solutions in real-world conditions â€” whether you're conducting fieldwork, 
        supporting a country-level review, or facilitating a stakeholder workshop.
      </p>

        <p>With this app, you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collect feedback from users and domain experts</li>
          <li>Score a digital tool's level of inclusiveness</li>
          <li>Generate structured reports and recommendations</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Once your evaluation is complete, you only need to connect briefly
        to the internet to <b>sync your data</b> or download
        updated materials from the MDII system.
